# Setting up your BTT SKR Pico to use katapult bootloader and Klipper with USB to CAN Bridge
This is a simple guide to getting the katapult bootloader, and Klipper with USB to CAN Bridge working. Well, hopefully it's simple, as that was my aim. Presumably, you are interested in this because you are on a path to adding a CAN-enabled tool head PCB.

This article is strictly focused on flashing the Pico firmware to make eventual communication with other CAN nodes possible. It stops short of getting into any tool head PCB firmware/configuration because I simply can't predict which PCB you might use. However, there many great supplementary resources to this guide out there which dive into that side of CAN/3D Printers. [This one from Rootiest](https://github.com/rootiest/zippy-klipper_config/blob/master/guides/Guide-pico_can.md), for example, shows you how to use an EBB board + transceiver.

If you are looking for more advanced ways of flashing katapult + Klipper, [this article from Polar Ted](https://github.com/Polar-Ted/RP2040Canboot_Install/blob/main/README.MD#canboot-for-skr-pico-in-usb-mode) may also be of use to you.

And, if you're looking for an article that covers CAN/Klipper more generally regardless of hardware, check [this article from Esoterical out](https://github.com/Esoterical/voron_canbus).

Shall we get started now?

## Assumptions
1. You know the general `make clean; make menuconfig; make` pattern typically seen with flashing MCUs.
2. You already have a printer working with a Raspberry Pi connected to the SKR Pico over USB.
3. You understand that you will be overwriting the current firmware on the BTT SKR Pico.

## Compiling katapult
1. SSH into your RPi
2. If you don't already have katapult cloned, run `git clone https://github.com/Arksine/katapult.git`
3. Run the following commands to get into the katapult configurator:
  ```
  cd katapult
  make clean
  make menuconfig
  ```
4. Make sure your settings match this screenshot:
  ![katapult Settings](canboot_settings.png)
5. Hit 'q' to quit, and 'y' to save
6. Run `make`

Checkpoint 1: The katapult bootloader file is now ready to be flashed to the SKR Pico. We'll do that next.

## Flashing katapult to the SKR Pico
1. Add a jumper to the BOOT pins on your SKR Pico:![SKR Pico Boot Jumper](SKR_Pico_Pin_Flashing.png)
2. Hit the reset button on your SKR Pico (this puts it into DFU/firmware flashing mode)
3. Confirm that the SKR Pico is in DFU mode by doing the following:
    1. WARNING: Before running the following step, confirm whether your Pico appears as `/dev/sda1`. You may need to replace `sda1` with something else depending on your setup. You can list your devices using the `lsblk` command. You want the device that is `128M` in size.
    2. Run: `sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`
    3. Run: `ls /mnt`
    4. You should see the following files: `INDEX.HTM`, `INFO_UF2.TXT`
4. Run: sudo cp ~/katapult/out/katapult.uf2 /mnt
5. The SKR Pico will now flash the katapult bootloader. You can confirm this process is complete by continuously running `ls /mnt` until you no longer see a list of files
6. Remove the BOOT jumper
7. Power off your printer, then power it back on

Checkpoint 2: At this point the katapult bootloader should now be flashed to your SKR Pico. Next steps are to flash Klipper with USB to CAN Bridge.

## Compiling Klipper with USB to CAN Bridge via katapult
1. SSH into your Pi
2. Run:
  ```
  cd klipper
  make clean
  make menuconfig
  ```
3. Make sure your settings match this screenshot:
  ![Klipper Settings](klipper_settings.png)
4. Hit 'q' to quit, and 'y' to save
5. Run `make`

Checkpoint 3: You have now compiled a version of Klipper with USB to CAN Bridge enabled. We'll flash it to the SKR Pico next.

## Flashing Klipper via katapult to the SKR Pico
1. Run `ls /dev/serial/by-id` and note the serial ID that contains the word `katapult` in it
2. Flash Klipper by running: `~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/katapult/scripts/flash_can.py -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -d /dev/serial/by-id/{your serial id}`
    1. If it wasn't obvious, you need to replace `{your serial id}` with the serial ID from step 1
3. The script will run, and you should see `CAN Flash Success` at the end
4. Power off your printer, then power it back on
5. SSH into your Pi
6. Run: `sudo ip link set up can0 type can bitrate 1000000`
    1. This will bring up the CAN network
7. Run: `~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0`
    1. This will list CAN devices on the network. You should see at least one, which is the CAN id for your SKR Pico. Write it down!
8. To help the CAN network survive firmware restarts, we'll want to configure the `can0` network to "allow for hotplug".
    1. Run the following:
    ```
    sudo rm /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0
    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0
    ```
    2. Paste the following into the text editor:
    ```
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 1000000
        up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 128
    ```
    3. Press `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor, followed by `Y` and `Enter` to save changes
9. Power off your printer, then power it back on

Checkpoint 4: You now have the katapult bootloader and Klipper with USB to CAN Bridge flashed to your SKR Pico!!! Next steps, update your printer.cfg.

At this point your SKR Pico Klipper instance is no longer available over a serial connection, and your printer isn't quite ready to use again. We need to update
the `[mcu]` config block for your SKR Pico.

## Updating your printer.cfg
1. Through the Mainsail/Fluidd UI, open your `printer.cfg` (or whatever file you have your `[mcu]` defined in).
2. Replace:
  ```
  [mcu]
  serial: /dev/serial/by-id/<your serial id>
  ```

  with
  ```
  [mcu]
  canbus_uuid: <your canbus id>
  ```
3. Restart Kliipper
4. After Klipper restarts you should see your MCU connected in Mainsail/Fluidd

## FINISH LINE
If everything was successful then you now have katapult and Klipper with the USB to CAN bridge working. This means you can now add more CAN devices to your network, such as the EBB36.
